Developed to fetch the smart meter data across the three main systems in the smart meter technology. The three main systems the SAP-ISU, Meter Data Management system and the Openway Collection Engine system data using the Oracle databases were joined effectively. It was used for the test data purposes, data concurrency checks and to identify the meter grouping based on its type.
The tool's architecture is flexible to be reused for different Utilities vendor implementation as well as it uses the SAP SQVI JOIN of ISU Standard data tables for the smart meter data retrieval.

Developed to configure the routers based on the vendor specific configurations.
Can be invoked to perform router configuration updates on multiple routers in sequence or in concurrency

- Cisco routers memory leak monitor application
Developed to connect and fetch memory data periodically from the router.
The memory leak data was later displayed using Highcharts graphical JQuery Javascript libraries to analyze and evaluate the memory leak

- Cisco routers time latency check application
Developed to connect and fetch time periodically from the router.
The time data was later displayed using Highcharts graphical JQuery Javascript libraries to evaluate the time latency. Apparently the time lag would cause the router to reboot and the lag delta needed to be identified and reported to the firmware department to be fixed.

- Independent scripts or tests launcher
Developed to launch, load and run the automated tests. It was scheduled for the daily run and the output test results were in the JSON format for the Node.JS app to pick it up and report.
