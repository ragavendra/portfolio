 Developed to fetch the smart meter data across the three main systems in the smart meter technology. The three main systems the SAP-ISU, Meter Data Management system and the Openway Collection Engine system data using the Oracle databases were joined effectively. It was used for the test data purposes, data concurrency checks and to identify the meter grouping based on its type.
The tool's architecture is flexible to be reused for different Utilities vendor implementation as well as it uses the SAP SQVI JOIN of ISU Standard data tables for the smart meter data retrieval.

_Cisco routers configuration automation script_
 Developed to configure the routers based on the vendor specific configurations.
Can be invoked to perform router configuration updates on multiple routers in sequence or in concurrency

_Cisco routers memory leak monitor application_
 Developed to connect and fetch memory data periodically from the router.
The memory leak data was later displayed using Highcharts graphical JQuery Javascript libraries to analyze and evaluate the memory leak

_Cisco routers time latency check application_
- Developed to connect and fetch time periodically from the router.
 The time data was later displayed using Highcharts graphical JQuery Javascript libraries to evaluate the time latency. Apparently the time lag would cause the router to reboot and the lag delta needed to be identified and reported to the firmware department to be fixed.

_Independent scripts or tests launcher_
 Developed to launch, load and run the automated tests. It was scheduled for the daily run and the output test results were in the JSON format for the Node.JS app to pick it up and report.

CDAC<br>
Jr. Embedded Developer<br>
Mar 2006 – Nov 2006<br>
Tools: GCC<br>
Platform: RTLinux<br>
Description:<br>
_Real-Time Linux driver for the serial port_
The aim of rt_com is to provide a easy interface to the serial port hardware from real-time contexts. It 
provides all needed functionality to communicate with electronic equipment along standard serial lines.
 Setting up of the serial port is done through the rt_com_setup. Writing data to the port is done through the
rt_com_write. Reading data from the port is achieved by the rt_com_read. Data structures such as the
rt_buf_struct, rt_com_struct and rt_com_table have been implemented. rt_buf_struct has been used to
implement software FIFO’s. rt_com_struct defines the hardware parameter of one serial port. Rt_com_table
helps to hold a rt_com_struct for each serial port to be handled by the module.
