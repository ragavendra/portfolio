provides all needed functionality to communicate with electronic equipment along standard serial lines.
 Setting up of the serial port is done through the rt_com_setup. Writing data to the port is done through the
rt_com_write. Reading data from the port is achieved by the rt_com_read. Data structures such as the
rt_buf_struct, rt_com_struct and rt_com_table have been implemented. rt_buf_struct has been used to
implement software FIFO’s. rt_com_struct defines the hardware parameter of one serial port. Rt_com_table
helps to hold a rt_com_struct for each serial port to be handled by the module.
